#TWO MOST IMP LIST MANIPULATION THINGS


1ST
"".join() =-----> will join the characters of a list to display like strings.
KNOW THAT IN STRINGS YOU CAN'T ASSIGN THEM A VALUE , IN LIST YOU CAN DO THAT


FOR EG:
CHAR = "HELLO"
CHAR[1] = WRONG #DONT DO THIS

CHAR = LIST(HELLO)
CHAR[1] = E ----->> PERFECTION.....


NOW TO THE GOAL OF DAY 7

# TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

# TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Print "Right" if it
#  is, "Wrong" if it's not.
